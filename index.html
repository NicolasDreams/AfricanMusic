        <h1>Soukous Music</h1>
        <p>
            <em>Soukous</em> is a genre of <strong>dance music</strong> from Congo-Kinshasa and Congo-Brazzaville.
            It derived from <em>Congolese rumba</em> in the 1960s, becoming known for its <strong>fast dance rhythms</strong> and <strong>intricate guitar improvisation</strong>, and gained popularity in the 1980s in France.

        <h2>A Brief History of Soukous</h2>
        <p>
            The history begins in the 1930s and 1940s when <strong>Afro-Cuban music groups</strong> that played <em>son Cubano</em> <strong>became popular on radio stations</strong> in the Congo and Kinshasa.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Beginnings of the sound.</h3>
                Because of the popularity of <em>son Cubano</em>, performers began to write their own Afro-Cuban music (called <em>rumba</em>).
                The sound generated several musicians who would create the foundation of <strong>soukous</strong>.

            <li><h3>Musicians fold in elements of US rock</h3>
                A decade later, many of the musicians who played with <em>TPOK Jazz</em> and <em>l'African Jazz</em> helped hone the soukous sound by <strong>adding US rock and soul</strong> elements to its polyglot sound.

            <li><h3>The Swahili sound is born</h3>
                Unrest in the DRC during the 1970s sent many soukous bands to neighboring countries.
                Once there, Congolese music <strong>began to influence local sounds and regional music</strong>, wich formed a new hybrid with soukous called <em>the Swahili sound</em>.
            </li>
            <li><h3>The genre continues to produce new variants</h3>
                Established soukous players began performing in Europe, while new soukous musicians found fame there.
                Soukous also <strong>began to branch out with new variants</strong>, like <em>kwassa kwassa</em>.
